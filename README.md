A tutoring site for Captain Coder.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Modifying Data

Projects can be modified in [projects.js](/util/projects.js).

Reviews can be modified in [reviews.js](/util/reviews.js).

## Modifying Styles

CSS variables can be found at the top of [globals.css](/styles/globals.css) in `:root`.

## Building

In order to build a [Static HTML Export](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export), run `npm run build`.

The resulting static HTML build should be available in `/out`.
